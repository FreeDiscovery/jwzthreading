0.92: 2010-06-14

* Ported test suite to unittest module.
* Removed __slots__ declarations; they pointlessly restrict what the
 user can do.
* Add several more tests.
* Improved docstrings.
* Made compatible with Python 3.x.

0.91:

* Include a license (BSD-style).
* Add a simple test suite; it still needs expansion.
